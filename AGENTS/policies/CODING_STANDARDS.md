# CODING_STANDARDS

## Purpose
Common engineering quality standards.

## Standards
1. TypeScript strictness and explicit types for public APIs.
2. Every change must include validation (typecheck/tests/build or smallest viable smoke check).
3. Update docs when behavior, contracts, or tooling changes.
4. Keep task records synchronized across BACKLOG/TODO/ARCHIVE/TASK_INDEX.
