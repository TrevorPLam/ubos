# TOOL_POLICY

## Purpose
Defines approved tool usage for automation and agent workflows.

## Policy

2. Use deterministic commands with reproducible outputs.
3. Capture verification commands in archive notes for each completed task.
4. Do not install runtime dependencies without explicit task scope.
