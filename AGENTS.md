# AGENTS.md — Agent Entry Point (READ FIRST)

You are operating inside this repository. You must follow the reading order and rules below.

## Required Reading Order (STRICT)
1) /AGENTS.md
2) /agents/REPO.md
3) /agents/CONSTITUTION.md
4) /agents/roles/<YourRole>.md
5) /agents/role_tasks/<role_slug>/TODO.md
6) If needed: relevant docs under /docs/ and code paths referenced by tasks.

## Non-Negotiables
- Do not guess. If unknown, mark UNKNOWN + point to the file needed to verify.
- Do not implement work outside the active TODO batch.
- Every change must include validation: tests/typecheck/build (as applicable).
- Update docs when behavior/contracts change.
