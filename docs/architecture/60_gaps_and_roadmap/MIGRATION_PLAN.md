# Migration Plan

**Purpose**: Step-by-step plan to migrate from current to target architecture  
**Status**: STUB - needs completion  
**Last Updated**: 2026-02-04

---

## Overview

See [GAP_ANALYSIS.md](GAP_ANALYSIS.md) for identified gaps.  
See [docs/architecture/00_plan_intent/TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md](/docs/architecture/00_plan_intent/TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md) for target state.

## Migration Strategy

**TODO**: Define overall migration approach:
- Incremental migration (recommended)
- Big bang migration
- Parallel run

---

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation (TODO)

**TODO**: Document foundation improvements:
- Complete authentication system
- Implement RBAC
- Add comprehensive audit logging

### Phase 2: Domain Refinement (TODO)

**TODO**: Document domain model improvements:
- Refine domain boundaries
- Add domain events
- Implement domain services

### Phase 3: Integration Layer (TODO)

**TODO**: Document integration improvements:
- External API integrations
- Webhook system
- Event processing

### Phase 4: Platform Services (TODO)

**TODO**: Document platform enhancements:
- Background job processing
- Caching layer
- Search infrastructure

## Risk Mitigation

### Risks

**TODO**: Document migration risks:
- Data migration risks
- Downtime risks
- Compatibility risks

### Mitigation Strategies

**TODO**: Document risk mitigation:
- Feature flags
- Rollback procedures
- Testing strategies

---

## Success Criteria

**TODO**: Define migration success criteria:
