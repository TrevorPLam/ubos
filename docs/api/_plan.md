# API Documentation Plan

Purpose: define ownership, structure, and conventions for API docs.

## Conventions
- Source of truth for current routes: [server/routes.ts](server/routes.ts).
- Each domain folder contains a `README.md` listing implemented endpoints and gaps.
- Use short request/response samples in docs/api/examples when needed.

## Ownership
- Backend/API owners update domain docs when routes change.
- Keep this plan aligned with [PLAN.md](PLAN.md).
