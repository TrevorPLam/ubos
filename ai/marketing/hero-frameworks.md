# Hero Frameworks

## Purpose

Conversion-optimized hero sections that capture attention and drive action. These frameworks are battle-tested formulas for maximum impact.

## Headline Formulas

### Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS)
```
[Problem] + [Agitation] + [Solution]

Example:
"Tired of slow websites? (Problem)
Losing customers to poor performance? (Agitation)
Get lightning-fast load times in 5 minutes. (Solution)"
```

### Before-After-Bridge (BAB)
```
[Before State] + [After State] + [Bridge]

Example:
"Managing projects is chaotic. (Before)
Imagine seamless collaboration and on-time delivery. (After)
Our platform bridges the gap. (Bridge)"
```

### Feature-Advantage-Benefit (FAB)
```
[Feature] + [Advantage] + [Benefit]

Example:
"AI-powered analytics (Feature)
that predict customer behavior (Advantage)
so you can increase revenue by 30%. (Benefit)"
```

### Question-Promise-Proof
```
[Question] + [Promise] + [Proof]

Example:
"What if you could double your conversion rate? (Question)
Our proven system does exactly that. (Promise)
Join 10,000+ companies who've already succeeded. (Proof)"
```

## CTA Button Rules

### CTA Text Formulas
- **Action + Benefit**: "Get Free Trial" → "Start Growing Today"
- **Urgency + Action**: "Sign Up" → "Get Started Before It's Gone"
- **Risk Reversal**: "Buy Now" → "Try Risk-Free for 30 Days"
- **Social Proof**: "Join" → "Join 50,000+ Smart Marketers"

### CTA Placement Rules
1. **Primary CTA**: Above the fold, center-aligned, high contrast
2. **Secondary CTA**: Below primary, less prominent, alternative action
3. **Tertiary CTA**: In navigation, subtle, for returning visitors

### CTA Design Requirements
- Minimum 44px height for touch targets
- High contrast ratio (4.5:1 minimum)
- Hover state with clear visual feedback
- Loading state for async actions
- Disabled state for form validation

## Visual Hierarchy

### Above the Fold Rules
1. **Headline**: Largest text, 2-3x body text size
2. **Subheadline**: 1.5x body text size, supporting message
3. **CTA Button**: High contrast, prominent placement
4. **Social Proof**: Below headline, above CTA
5. **Visual Element**: Right side (LTR), supports message

### Image/Video Requirements
- **Hero Images**: 1200x600px minimum, optimized for WebP
- **Hero Videos**: 15-30 seconds, autoplay muted, loop
- **Product Images**: Clean background, professional lighting

## Social Proof Integration

### Trust Signals Placement

2. **Below CTA**: Customer logos, testimonials
3. **Side Panel**: Live notifications, recent activity
4. **Footer**: Certifications, awards, press mentions

### Social Proof Types

- **Qualitative**: Customer quotes, case studies
- **Authority**: "Featured in Forbes", "Gartner Leader"
- **Community**: "Join 50,000+ professionals"

## Mobile Optimization

### Mobile Hero Rules
- **Stacked Layout**: Headline → CTA → Social Proof → Image
- **Thumb-Friendly CTA**: Bottom 25% of screen
- **Readable Text**: Minimum 16px font size
- **Fast Loading**: Hero image < 100KB compressed

### Responsive Breakpoints
- **Mobile**: 320-768px (single column)
- **Tablet**: 768-1024px (two-column layout)
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ (full hero layout)

## Performance Requirements

### Loading Priorities
1. **Critical CSS**: Inline, above-the-fold styles
2. **Hero Image**: Preload, optimized format
3. **Web Fonts**: Display swap strategy
4. **JavaScript**: Non-blocking, deferred

### Speed Targets
- **First Contentful Paint**: < 1.5s
- **Largest Contentful Paint**: < 2.5s
- **Time to Interactive**: < 3.0s
- **Cumulative Layout Shift**: < 0.1

## A/B Testing Frameworks

### Hero Element Testing
1. **Headline Variations**: Test different formulas
2. **CTA Text**: Action vs. benefit focus
3. **Visual Elements**: Image vs. video vs. illustration
4. **Social Proof**: Numbers vs. logos vs. testimonials

### Testing Priorities
1. **Headline**: Highest impact, test first
2. **CTA**: Second highest impact
3. **Visual**: Medium impact, test after copy
4. **Layout**: Lower impact, test last

## Conversion Psychology

### Urgency Elements
- **Scarcity**: "Only 3 spots left"
- **Time-based**: "Offer ends in 24 hours"
- **Social**: "500 people viewing this"
- **Loss Aversion**: "Don't miss out on..."

### Trust Builders
- **Transparency**: "No credit card required"
- **Risk Reversal**: "30-day money-back guarantee"
- **Authority**: "Trusted by Fortune 500 companies"
- **Consistency**: "Join others like you"
