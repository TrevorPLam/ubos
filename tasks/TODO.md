# Current Sprints & Active Tasks

<!--
SYSTEM INSTRUCTIONS — TODO.md (agent-enforced)

Purpose: Active work queue. This file MUST contain tasks of a SINGLE batch type.

Canonical workflow + templates live in: TASKS.md

Global Rules:
1) Task blocks MUST be wrapped with:
   ## task_begin
   ## task_end
2) Every task MUST include tags in the title line:
   [id:...][type:...][priority:...][component:...]
3) Batch rules:
   - TODO.md MUST contain only ONE [type:*] at a time.
   - Batch size target: 5 tasks (or fewer if backlog has fewer).
   - Do NOT add tasks manually unless explicitly instructed.
4) Ordering rules:
   - Preserve the order as moved from BACKLOG.md.
   - Do NOT reorder unless explicitly instructed.
5) Completion rules:
   - When Status becomes done, MOVE the entire task block to ARCHIVE.md.
   - Remove it from TODO.md after archiving.
6) Notes discipline:
   - "Notes & Summary" is for execution logs and final summaries.
   - Keep Notes <= 10 lines. Prefer bullets. No long transcripts.
