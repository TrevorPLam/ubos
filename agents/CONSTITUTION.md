# CONSTITUTION.md — Global Rules for All Agents

## Safety / Security
- No secrets in code, docs, logs, tests.
- No weakening auth, tenancy, or security controls to “make tests pass.”
- Any risk acceptance requires a written entry with expiry + compensating controls.

## Verification Policy (Mandatory)
- Before claiming done: run relevant commands.
- If you can’t run, provide exact commands + expected outputs.
- No claims like “military-grade.” Use verifiable controls and standards mappings.

## Scope Control
- Only work items in the active TODO batch.
- If additional tasks need to be created after you complete your task to compliment your work, they must be reported in the summary of your PR.

## Change Discipline
- If you introduce a new convention, document it in /docs and REPO.md.
